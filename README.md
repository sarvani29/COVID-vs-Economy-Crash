# Covid-vs-Economy-Crash

A novel pair of visualizations (a Choropleth map and an Index Chart) have been made to exhibit a correlation between the increasing cases of COVID-19 globally with the falling economy, taking Composite index as the economy evaluation metric and considering five countries - China, France, Germany, Spain and US. The visualizations are made using Plotly and D3.
